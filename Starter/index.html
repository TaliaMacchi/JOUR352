<p class="leadGraph">Hi, my name is Talia Macchi and I am a sophomore at the University of Maryland. I am from <strong> Wayland, MA, </strong> which is about 20 minutes outside of Boston.</p>

<h3>Here are some fun facts about me:</h3>

<p>The movie “The Devil Wears Prada” inspired me to go into journalism because it gave me a glimpse into the world of magazine writing. I was intrigued by the main character Andrea’s road from news reporting to working for a high end magazine, and I enjoyed seeing how her confidence and style evolved throughout her experience. The movie showcased the importance of being adaptable and curious, and seeing Andrea grow into someone who could balance her integrity with a demanding boss made me want to pursue a career where I can tell meaningful stories, stay informed and attend fun events. I currenrly write for<a href="https://dbknews.com/" target="_blank" > The Diamondback. </a></p>

<p>As for my ideal superpower, it would be teleportation. Although I love being at college, I often crave being at home with my family, especially this past Sunday watching the superbowl. As a new englander would spend her summers in cape cod, I also often crave the sun, so it would be awesome to teleport to warm beaches on rainy cold days in college park.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am not a picky eater so there is not a vegetable I would despise. If I had to choose, I would choose an onion because they make people cry. </p>
